* Market-leading VOC adsorbtion fine tuned for _aromatic hydrocarbons emitted during 3D printing_ such as styrene, benzaldehyde, toluene, benzene, etc. [**CTC >=80**, benzene adsorbtion capacity up to **0.48g/g**]
* Market-leading surface area (storage capacity) of **1250m2/g**! 
* Vacuum packed for minimal dust generation during shipping.
* Vacuum dedusted during the packaging process for immidiate use in 3d printers
* Available in Regular (750ml) and XL (2300ml)

# Nevermore Scorch

* Zeolite-based, highly microporous adsorption medium, enhanced with potassium permanganate (KMnO4).
* Chimically transform printer VOC toxins like styrene – a major VOC in ABS filaments – into harmless potassium benzoate (food additive).
* The process is not harmed by high chamber temps, but accelerated, making Nevermore Scorch ideal for heated 3D printer chambers!
* Colour changes from bright purple to a dullish gray as its being spent, giving a visual indication of when its time to swap filter media!

# Nevermore Mix

* Pre-prepared 50/50 mix of Nevermore Carbon and Nevermore Scorch; a less-hassle, best-of-both-worlds printer filtration
* Combining the long-life och stellar adsobtion capacity of activated carbon with Nevermore Scorch performance in hot surroundings.
* Ideal for most users with enclosed 3d printers printing ABS/ASA/PETG/PC in chamber temps of 50C +-10C.

# HEPA

* Nevermore Hepa filters.
